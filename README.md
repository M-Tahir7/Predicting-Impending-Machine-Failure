# Predicting-Impending-Machine-Failure
Machine failure prediction using various ML algorithms. After testing multiple models, the Decision Tree algorithm provided the best results with 97% accuracy. I applied data preprocessing, feature engineering, and SMOTE for class imbalance. The model was deployed using Gradio for interactive use.
